# item_browser

## Summary

The item_browser allows you to browse through a selection of items, which are stored in a .csv file. On the top, you find a searchbar with which you can search for specific items and filter by gender and items on sale. The rendered items are being updated instantly.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository with: `https://github.com/stekeb/item_browser.git`
2. Run `npm install`
3. To generate a production build run `npm run build` and then `npm install -g serve`
4. To open the production build in your browser run `serve -s build`. This will run the website on `http://localhost:5000/`. If you would like to run it on another port use e.g. `serve -s build -l 4000` to run it on port 4000.
5. The application comes with a series of tests which can be run with `npm test`
